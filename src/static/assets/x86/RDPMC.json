The EDX register is loaded with the supported high-order bits of the counter. The number of high-order bits loaded into EDX is implementation specific on processors that do no support architectural performance monitoring. The width of fixed-function and general-purpose performance counters on processors supporting architectural performance monitoring are reported by CPUID 0AH leaf. See below for the treatment of the EDX register for “fast” reads."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The ECX register specifies the counter type (if the processor supports architectural performance monitoring) and counter index. Counter type is specified in ECX[30] to select one of two type of performance counters. If the processor does not support architectural performance monitoring, ECX[30:0] specifies the counter index; otherwise ECX[29:0] specifies the index relative to the base of each counter type. ECX[31] selects “fast” read mode if supported. The two counter types are:"}],"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
