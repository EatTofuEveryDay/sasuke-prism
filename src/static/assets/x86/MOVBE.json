{"title":"MOVBE â€” Move Data After Swapping Bytes","fields":[{"name":"Description","value":"Performs a byte swap operation on the data copied from the second operand (source operand) and store the result in the first operand (destination operand). The source operand can be a general-purpose register, or memory location; the destination register can be a general-purpose register, or a memory location; however, both operands can not be registers, and only one operand can be a memory location. Both operands must be the same size, which can be a word, a doubleword or quadword."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The MOVBE instruction is provided for swapping the bytes on a read from memory or on a write to memory; thus providing support for converting little-endian values to big-endian format and vice versa."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"In 64-bit mode, the instruction's default operation size is 32 bits. Use of the REX.R prefix permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Use of the REX.W prefix promotes operation to 64 bits. See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits."}],"color":65535,"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
