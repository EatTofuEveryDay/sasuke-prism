The source operand can be register AL, AX, or EAX, depending on the size of the port being accessed (8, 16, or 32 bits, respectively); the destination operand can be a byte-immediate or the DX register. Using a byte immediate allows I/O port addresses 0 to 255 to be accessed; using the DX register as a source operand allows I/O ports from 0 to 65,535 to be accessed."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The size of the I/O port being accessed is determined by the opcode for an 8-bit I/O port or by the operand-size attribute of the instruction for a 16- or 32-bit I/O port."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"At the machine code level, I/O instructions are shorter when accessing 8-bit I/O ports. Here, the upper eight bits of the port address will be 0."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"This instruction is only useful for accessing I/O ports located in the processor’s I/O address space.
