{"title":"DAA â€” Decimal Adjust AL after Addition","fields":[{"name":"Instruction Modes","value":"`DAA`"},{"name":"Description","value":"Adjusts the sum of two packed BCD values to create a packed BCD result. The AL register is the implied source and destination operand. The DAA instruction is only useful when it follows an ADD instruction that adds (binary addition) two 2-digit, packed BCD values and stores a byte result in the AL register. The DAA instruction then adjusts the contents of the AL register to contain the correct 2-digit, packed BCD result. If a decimal carry is detected, the CF and AF flags are set accordingly."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"This instruction executes as described above in compatibility mode and legacy mode.
