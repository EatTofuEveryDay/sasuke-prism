The rounding process rounds each input floating-point value to an integer value and returns the integer result as a double-precision floating-point value."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The immediate operand specifies control fields for the rounding operation, three bit fields are defined and shown in Figure 4-24. Bit 3 of the immediate byte controls processor behavior for a precision exception, bit 2 selects the source of rounding mode control. Bits 1:0 specify a non-sticky rounding-mode value (Table 4-17 lists the encoded values for rounding-mode field)."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The Precision Floating-Point Exception is signaled according to the immediate operand. If any source operand is an SNaN then it will be converted to a QNaN.
