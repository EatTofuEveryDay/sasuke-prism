The constants that can be loaded with these instructions include +1.0, +0.0, log210, log2e, π, log102, and loge2. For each constant, an internal 66-bit constant is rounded (as specified by the RC field in the FPU control word) to double extended-precision floating-point format. The inexact-result exception (#P) is not generated as a result of the rounding, nor is the C1 flag set in the x87 FPU status word if the value is rounded up."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"See the section titled “Approximation of Pi” in Chapter 8 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, for a description of the π constant."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode."}],"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
