(See Figure 4-6 for an example of the packing operation.) If a signed word integer value is beyond the range of an unsigned byte integer (that is, greater than FFH or less than 00H), the saturated unsigned byte integer value of FFH or 00H, respectively, is stored in the destination."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"EVEX.512 encoded version: The first source operand is a ZMM register.
