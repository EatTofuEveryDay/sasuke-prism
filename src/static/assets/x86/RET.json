The address is usually placed on the stack by a CALL instruction, and the return is made to the instruction that follows the CALL instruction."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The optional source operand specifies the number of stack bytes to be released after the return address is popped; the default is none. This operand can be used to release parameters from the stack that were passed to the called procedure and are no longer needed. It must be used when the CALL instruction used to switch to a new procedure uses a call gate with a non-zero word count to access the new procedure. Here, the source operand for the RET instruction must specify the same number of bytes as is specified in the word count field of the call gate."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The RET instruction can be used to execute three different types of returns:"}],"color":65535,"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
