For more details on these values, see Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3C, Section 35.2.2, “Software Trace Instrumentation with PTWRITE”. The size of data is 64-bit if using REX.W in 64-bit mode, otherwise 32-bits of data are copied from the source operand."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"Note: The instruction will #UD if prefix 66H is used."}],"color":65535,"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
