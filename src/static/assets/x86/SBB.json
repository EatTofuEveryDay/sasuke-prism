The result of the subtraction is stored in the destination operand. The destination operand can be a register or a memory location; the source operand can be an immediate, a register, or a memory location. (However, two memory operands cannot be used in one instruction.) The state of the CF flag represents a borrow from a previous subtraction."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"When an immediate value is used as an operand, it is sign-extended to the length of the destination operand format."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The SBB instruction does not distinguish between signed or unsigned operands. Instead, the processor evaluates the result for both data types and sets the OF and CF flags to indicate a borrow in the signed or unsigned result, respectively. The SF flag indicates the sign of the signed result."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The SBB instruction is usually executed as part of a multibyte or multiword subtraction in which a SUB instruction is followed by a SBB instruction."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the instruction to be executed atomically."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits.
