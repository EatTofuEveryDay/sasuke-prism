For each bit set in the MASK, PEXT extracts the corresponding bits from the first source operand and writes them into contiguous lower bits of destination operand. The remaining upper bits of destination are zeroed."},{"name":"C/C++ Intrinsics","value":"`PEXT: unsigned __int32 _pext_u32(unsigned __int32 src, unsigned __int32 mask);\n`"},{"name":"\u200b","value":"`PEXT: unsigned __int64 _pext_u64(unsigned __int64 src, unsigned __int32 mask);\n`"},{"name":"CPUID Flags","value":"BMI2"}],"color":65535,"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
