{"title":"STR â€” Store Task Register","fields":[{"name":"Instruction Modes","value":"`STR r/m16`"},{"name":"Description","value":"Stores the segment selector from the task register (TR) in the destination operand. The destination operand can be a general-purpose register or a memory location. The segment selector stored with this instruction points to the task state segment (TSS) for the currently running task."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"When the destination operand is a 32-bit register, the 16-bit segment selector is copied into the lower 16 bits of the register and the upper 16 bits of the register are cleared. When the destination operand is a memory location, the segment selector is written to memory as a 16-bit quantity, regardless of operand size."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"In 64-bit mode, operation is the same. The size of the memory operand is fixed at 16 bits. In register stores, the 2-byte TR is zero extended if stored to a 64-bit register."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The STR instruction is useful only in operating-system software. It can only be executed in protected mode."}],"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
