Each set bit in imm8 specifies a category of floating-point values that the input data element is classified against. The classified results of all specified categories of an input value are ORed together to form the final boolean result for the input element. The result is written to the low bit in a mask register k2 according to the writemask k1. Bits MAX_KL-1: 1 of the destination are cleared."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The classification categories specified by imm8 are shown in Figure 5-13.
