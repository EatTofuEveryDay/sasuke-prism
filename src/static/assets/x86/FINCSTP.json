{"title":"FINCSTP — Increment Stack-Top Pointer","fields":[{"name":"Instruction Modes","value":"`FINCSTP`"},{"name":"Description","value":"Adds one to the TOP field of the FPU status word (increments the top-of-stack pointer). If the TOP field contains a 7, it is set to 0. The effect of this instruction is to rotate the stack by one position. The contents of the FPU data registers and tag register are not affected. This operation is not equivalent to popping the stack, because the tag for the previous top-of-stack register is not marked empty."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode."}],"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
