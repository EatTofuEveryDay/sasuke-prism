The source operand can be an XMM register or a 32-bit memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register. The three high-order doublewords of the destination operand remain unchanged. See Figure 10-6 in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, for an illustration of a scalar single-precision floating-point operation."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The relative error for this approximation is:"},{"name":"\u200b","value":"|Relative Error| ≤ 1.5 ∗ 2−12"},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The RSQRTSS instruction is not affected by the rounding control bits in the MXCSR register. When a source value is a 0.0, an ∞ of the sign of the source value is returned. A denormal source value is treated as a 0.0 (of the same sign). When a source value is a negative value (other than −0.0), a floating-point indefinite is returned. When a source value is an SNaN or QNaN, the SNaN is converted to a QNaN or the source QNaN is returned."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"In 64-bit mode, using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits this instruction to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15)."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"128-bit Legacy SSE version: The first source operand and the destination operand are the same.
