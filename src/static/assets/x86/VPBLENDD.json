The immediate bits (bits 7:0) form a mask that determines whether the corresponding word in the destination is copied from the source. If a bit in the mask, corresponding to a word, is “1\", then the word is copied, else the word is unchanged."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"VEX.128 encoded version: The second source operand can be an XMM register or a 128-bit memory location.
