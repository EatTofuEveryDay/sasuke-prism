The source operand can be an XMM register or a 128-bit memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register. See Figure 10-5 in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, for an illustration of a SIMD single-precision floating-point operation."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The relative error for this approximation is:"},{"name":"\u200b","value":"|Relative Error| ≤ 1.5 ∗ 2−12"},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The RCPPS instruction is not affected by the rounding control bits in the MXCSR register. When a source value is a 0.0, an ∞ of the sign of the source value is returned. A denormal source value is treated as a 0.0 (of the same sign). Tiny results (see Section 4.9.1.5, “Numeric Underflow Exception (#U)” in Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1) are always flushed to 0.0, with the sign of the operand. (Input values greater than or equal to |1.11111111110100000000000B∗2125| are guaranteed to not produce tiny results; input values less than or equal to |1.00000000000110000000001B*2126| are guaranteed to produce tiny results, which are in turn flushed to 0.0; and input values in between this range may or may not produce tiny results, depending on the implementation.)
