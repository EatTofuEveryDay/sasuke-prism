The first value is an xmm (or possibly m128 for the second operand) which contains the data elements of the string (byte or word data). The second value is stored in an input length register. The input length register is EAX/RAX (for xmm1) or EDX/RDX (for xmm2/m128). The length represents the number of bytes/words which are valid for the respective xmm/m128 data."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The length of each input is interpreted as being the absolute-value of the value in the length register. The absolute-value computation saturates to 16 (for bytes) and 8 (for words), based on the value of imm8[bit3] when the value in the length register is greater than 16 (8) or less than -16 (-8)."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The comparison and aggregation operations are performed according to the encoded value of Imm8 bit fields (see Section 4.1). The index of the first (or last, according to imm8[6]) set bit of IntRes2 (see Section 4.1.4) is returned in ECX. If no bits are set in IntRes2, ECX is set to 16 (8)."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"Note that the Arithmetic Flags are written in a non-standard manner in order to supply the most relevant information:"},{"name":"\u200b","value":"CFlag – Reset if IntRes2 is equal to zero, set otherwise"},{"name":"\u200b","value":"ZFlag – Set if absolute-value of EDX is &lt; 16 (8), reset otherwise"},{"name":"\u200b","value":"SFlag – Set if absolute-value of EAX is &lt; 16 (8), reset otherwise"},{"name":"\u200b","value":"OFlag – IntRes2[0]"},{"name":"\u200b","value":"AFlag – Reset"},{"name":"\u200b","value":"PFlag – Reset"},{"name":"CPUID Flags","value":"SSE4_2"}],"color":65535,"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
