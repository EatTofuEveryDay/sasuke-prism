The source operand must be given in radians and must be less than ±263. The following table shows the unmasked results obtained when computing the partial tangent of various classes of numbers, assuming that underflow does not occur."}],"color":65535,"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
