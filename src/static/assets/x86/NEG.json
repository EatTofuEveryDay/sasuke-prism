(This operation is equivalent to subtracting the operand from 0.) The destination operand is located in a general-purpose register or a memory location."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the instruction to be executed atomically."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64 bits. See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits."}],"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
