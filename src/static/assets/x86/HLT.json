{"title":"HLT — Halt","fields":[{"name":"Instruction Modes","value":"`HLT`"},{"name":"Description","value":"Stops instruction execution and places the processor in a HALT state. An enabled interrupt (including NMI and SMI), a debug exception, the BINIT# signal, the INIT# signal, or the RESET# signal will resume execution. If an interrupt (including NMI) is used to resume execution after a HLT instruction, the saved instruction pointer (CS:EIP) points to the instruction following the HLT instruction."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"When a HLT instruction is executed on an Intel 64 or IA-32 processor supporting Intel Hyper-Threading Technology, only the logical processor that executes the instruction is halted. The other logical processors in the physical processor remain active, unless they are each individually halted by executing a HLT instruction."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The HLT instruction is a privileged instruction.
