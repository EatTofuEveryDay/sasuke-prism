The INDEX is specified by bits 7:0 of the second source operand. The INDEX value is saturated at the value of OperandSize -1. CF is set, if the number contained in the 8 low bits of the third operand is greater than OperandSize -1."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"This instruction is not supported in real mode and virtual-8086 mode. The operand size is always 32 bits if not in 64-bit mode. In 64-bit mode operand size 64 requires VEX.W1. VEX.W1 is ignored in non-64-bit modes. An attempt to execute this instruction with VEX.L not equal to 0 will cause #UD."},{"name":"C/C++ Intriniscs","value":"`BZHI: unsigned __int32 _bzhi_u32(unsigned __int32 src, unsigned __int32 index);\n`"},{"name":"\u200b","value":"`BZHI: unsigned __int64 _bzhi_u64(unsigned __int64 src, unsigned __int32 index);\n`"},{"name":"CPUID Flags","value":"BMI2"}],"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
