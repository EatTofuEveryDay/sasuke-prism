The registers are loaded in the following order: EDI, ESI, EBP, EBX, EDX, ECX, and EAX (if the operand-size attribute is 32) and DI, SI, BP, BX, DX, CX, and AX (if the operand-size attribute is 16). (These instructions reverse the operation of the PUSHA/PUSHAD instructions.) The value on the stack for the ESP or SP register is ignored. Instead, the ESP or SP register is incremented after each register is loaded."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The POPA (pop all) and POPAD (pop all double) mnemonics reference the same opcode. The POPA instruction is intended for use when the operand-size attribute is 16 and the POPAD instruction for when the operand-size attribute is 32. Some assemblers may force the operand size to 16 when POPA is used and to 32 when POPAD is used (using the operand-size override prefix [66H] if necessary). Others may treat these mnemonics as synonyms (POPA/POPAD) and use the current setting of the operand-size attribute to determine the size of values to be popped from the stack, regardless of the mnemonic used. (The D flag in the current code segment’s segment descriptor determines the operand-size attribute.)"},{"name":"\u200b","value":"This instruction executes as described in non-64-bit modes.
