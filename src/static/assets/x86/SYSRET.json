It returns from an OS system-call handler to user code at privilege level 3. It does so by loading RIP from RCX and loading RFLAGS from R11.1 With a 64-bit operand size, SYSRET remains in 64-bit mode; otherwise, it enters compatibility mode and only the low 32 bits of the registers are loaded."}],"color":65535,"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
