{"title":"FSINCOS — Sine and Cosine","fields":[{"name":"Instruction Modes","value":"`FSINCOS`"},{"name":"Description","value":"Computes both the approximate sine and the cosine of the source operand in register ST(0), stores the sine in ST(0), and pushes the cosine onto the top of the FPU register stack. (This instruction is faster than executing the FSIN and FCOS instructions in succession.)"},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The source operand must be given in radians and must be within the range −263 to +263.
