{"title":"FBSTP â€” Store BCD Integer and Pop","fields":[{"name":"Instruction Modes","value":"`FBSTP m80bcd`"},{"name":"Description","value":"Converts the value in the ST(0) register to an 18-digit packed BCD integer, stores the result in the destination operand, and pops the register stack. If the source value is a non-integral value, it is rounded to an integer value, according to rounding mode specified by the RC field of the FPU control word. To pop the register stack, the processor marks the ST(0) register as empty and increments the stack pointer (TOP) by 1."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The destination operand specifies the address where the first byte destination value is to be stored. The BCD value (including its sign bit) requires 10 bytes of space in memory."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The following table shows the results obtained when storing various classes of numbers in packed BCD format."}],"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
