TZCNT is an extension of the BSF instruction. The key difference between TZCNT and BSF instruction is that TZCNT provides operand size as output when source operand is zero while in the case of BSF instruction, if source operand is zero, the content of destination operand are undefined. On processors that do not support TZCNT, the instruction byte encoding is executed as BSF."},{"name":"C/C++ Intriniscs","value":"`TZCNT: unsigned __int32 _tzcnt_u32(unsigned __int32 src);\n`"},{"name":"\u200b","value":"`TZCNT: unsigned __int64 _tzcnt_u64(unsigned __int64 src);\n`"},{"name":"CPUID Flags","value":"BMI1"}],"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
