VPMOVSQB converts signed 64-bit integers into packed signed bytes using signed saturation. VPMOVUSQB convert unsigned quad-word values into unsigned byte values using unsigned saturation. The source operand is a vector register. The destination operand is an XMM register or a memory location."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"Down-converted byte elements are written to the destination operand (the first operand) from the least-significant byte.
