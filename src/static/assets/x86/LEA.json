{"title":"LEA â€” Load Effective Address","fields":[{"name":"Instruction Modes","value":"`LEA r16,m`\n`LEA r32,m`\n`LEA r64,m`"},{"name":"Description","value":"Computes the effective address of the second operand (the source operand) and stores it in the first operand (destination operand). The source operand is a memory address (offset part) specified with one of the processors addressing modes; the destination operand is a general-purpose register. The address-size and operand-size attributes affect the action performed by this instruction, as shown in the following table. The operand-size attribute of the instruction is determined by the chosen register; the address-size attribute is determined by the attribute of the code segment."}],"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
