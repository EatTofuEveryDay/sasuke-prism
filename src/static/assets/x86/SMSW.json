When the destination operand is a memory location, the low-order 16 bits of register CR0 are written to memory as a 16-bit quantity, regardless of the operand size."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"In 64-bit mode, the behavior of the SMSW instruction is defined by the following examples:"}],"color":65535,"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
