The second source operand can be an XMM register or a 64-bit memory location. The first source and destination operands are XMM registers. When the second source operand is a memory operand, only 64 bits are accessed."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"If the values being compared are both 0.0s (of either sign), the value in the second source operand is returned. If a value in the second source operand is an SNaN, that SNaN is returned unchanged to the destination (that is, a QNaN version of the SNaN is not returned)."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"If only one value is a NaN (SNaN or QNaN) for this instruction, the second source operand, either a NaN or a valid floating-point value, is written to the result. If instead of this behavior, it is required that the NaN of either source operand be returned, the action of MAXSD can be emulated using a sequence of instructions, such as, a comparison followed by AND, ANDN and OR."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"128-bit Legacy SSE version: The destination and first source operand are the same.
