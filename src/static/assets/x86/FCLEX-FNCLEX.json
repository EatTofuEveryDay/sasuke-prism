{"title":"FCLEX/FNCLEX â€” Clear Exceptions","fields":[{"name":"Instruction Modes","value":"`FCLEX`\n`FNCLEX*`"},{"name":"Description","value":"Clears the floating-point exception flags (PE, UE, OE, ZE, DE, and IE), the exception summary status flag (ES), the stack fault flag (SF), and the busy flag (B) in the FPU status word. The FCLEX instruction checks for and handles any pending unmasked floating-point exceptions before clearing the exception flags; the FNCLEX instruction does not."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The assembler issues two instructions for the FCLEX instruction (an FWAIT instruction followed by an FNCLEX instruction), and the processor executes each of these instructions separately. If an exception is generated for either of these instructions, the save EIP points to the instruction that caused the exception."}],"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
