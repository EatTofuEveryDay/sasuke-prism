The lower 128-bits of the registers (the corresponding XMM registers) are unmodified."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"This instruction is recommended when transitioning between AVX and legacy SSE code - it will eliminate performance penalties caused by false dependencies."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"Note: VEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b otherwise instructions will #UD. In Compatibility and legacy 32-bit mode only the lower 8 registers are modified."},{"name":"C/C++ Intrinsics","value":"`VZEROUPPER: _mm256_zeroupper()\n`"},{"name":"CPUID Flags","value":"AVX"}],"color":65535,"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
