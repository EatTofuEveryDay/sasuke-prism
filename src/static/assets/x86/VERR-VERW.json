The source operand is a 16-bit register or a memory location that contains the segment selector for the segment to be verified. If the segment is accessible and readable (VERR) or writable (VERW), the ZF flag is set; otherwise, the ZF flag is cleared. Code segments are never verified as writable. This check cannot be performed on system segments."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"To set the ZF flag, the following conditions must be met:"}],"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
