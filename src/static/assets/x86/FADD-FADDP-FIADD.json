The one-operand version adds the contents of a memory location (either a floating-point or an integer value) to the contents of the ST(0) register. The two-operand version, adds the contents of the ST(0) register to the ST(i) register or vice versa.

To pop the register stack, the processor marks the ST(0) register as empty and increments the stack pointer (TOP) by 1. (The no-operand version of the floating-point add instructions always results in the register stack being popped. In some assemblers, the mnemonic for this instruction is FADD rather than FADDP.)"},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The FIADD instructions convert an integer source operand to double extended-precision floating-point format before performing the addition."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The table on the following page shows the results obtained when adding various classes of numbers, assuming that neither overflow nor underflow occurs."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"When the sum of two operands with opposite signs is 0, the result is +0, except for the round toward −∞ mode, in which case the result is −0.
