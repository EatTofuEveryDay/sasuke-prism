{"title":"BSWAP — Byte Swap","fields":[{"name":"Instruction Modes","value":"`BSWAP r32`\n`BSWAP r64`"},{"name":"Description","value":"Reverses the byte order of a 32-bit or 64-bit (destination) register. This instruction is provided for converting little-endian values to big-endian format and vice versa. To swap bytes in a word value (16-bit register), use the XCHG instruction. When the BSWAP instruction references a 16-bit register, the result is undefined."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64 bits. See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits."}],"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
