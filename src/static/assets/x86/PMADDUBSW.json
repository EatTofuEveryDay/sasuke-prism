Each adjacent pair of signed words is added and the saturated result is packed to the destination operand. For example, the lowest-order bytes (bits 7-0) in the source and destination operands are multiplied and the intermediate signed word result is added with the corresponding intermediate result from the 2nd lowest-order bytes (bits 15-8) of the operands; the sign-saturated result is stored in the lowest word of the destination register (15-0). The same operation is performed on the other pairs of adjacent bytes. Both operands can be MMX register or XMM registers. When the source operand is a 128-bit memory operand, the operand must be aligned on a 16-byte boundary or a general-protection exception (#GP) will be generated."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"In 64-bit mode and not encoded with VEX/EVEX, use the REX prefix to access XMM8-XMM15."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"128-bit Legacy SSE version: The first source and destination operands are XMM registers.
