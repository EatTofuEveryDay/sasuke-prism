{"title":"DAS â€” Decimal Adjust AL after Subtraction","fields":[{"name":"Instruction Modes","value":"`DAS`"},{"name":"Description","value":"Adjusts the result of the subtraction of two packed BCD values to create a packed BCD result. The AL register is the implied source and destination operand. The DAS instruction is only useful when it follows a SUB instruction that subtracts (binary subtraction) one 2-digit, packed BCD value from another and stores a byte result in the AL register. The DAS instruction then adjusts the contents of the AL register to contain the correct 2-digit, packed BCD result. If a decimal borrow is detected, the CF and AF flags are set accordingly."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"This instruction executes as described above in compatibility mode and legacy mode. It is not valid in 64-bit mode."}],"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
