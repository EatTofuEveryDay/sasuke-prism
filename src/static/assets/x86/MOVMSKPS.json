The source operand is an XMM or YMM register, and the destination operand is a general-purpose register. The mask is stored in the 4 or 8 low-order bits of the destination operand. The upper bits of the destination operand beyond the mask are filled with zeros."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"In 64-bit mode, the instruction can access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15, R8-R15) when used with a REX.R prefix. The default operand size is 64-bit in 64-bit mode."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"128-bit versions: The source operand is a YMM register. The destination operand is a general purpose register."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"VEX.256 encoded version: The source operand is a YMM register.
