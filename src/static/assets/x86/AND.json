The source operand can be an immediate, a register, or a memory location; the destination operand can be a register or a memory location. (However, two memory operands cannot be used in one instruction.) Each bit of the result is set to 1 if both corresponding bits of the first and second operands are 1; otherwise, it is set to 0."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the it to be executed atomically."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits.
