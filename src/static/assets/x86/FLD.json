{"title":"FLD — Load Floating Point Value","fields":[{"name":"Instruction Modes","value":"`FLD m32fp`\n`FLD m64fp`\n`FLD m80fp`\n`FLD ST(i)`"},{"name":"Description","value":"Pushes the source operand onto the FPU register stack. The source operand can be in single-precision, double-precision, or double extended-precision floating-point format. If the source operand is in single-precision or double-precision floating-point format, it is automatically converted to the double extended-precision floating-point format before being pushed on the stack."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The FLD instruction can also push the value in a selected FPU register [ST(i)] onto the stack. Here, pushing register ST(0) duplicates the stack top."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode."}],"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
