The rounding process rounds a single-precision floating-point input to an integer value and returns the result as a single-precision floating-point value in the lowest position. The upper three single-precision floating-point values in the destination are retained."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The immediate operand specifies control fields for the rounding operation, three bit fields are defined and shown in Figure 4-24. Bit 3 of the immediate byte controls processor behavior for a precision exception, bit 2 selects the source of rounding mode control. Bits 1:0 specify a non-sticky rounding-mode value (Table 4-17 lists the encoded values for rounding-mode field)."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The Precision Floating-Point Exception is signaled according to the immediate operand. If any source operand is an SNaN then it will be converted to a QNaN. If DAZ is set to ‘1 then denormals will be converted to zero before rounding."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"128-bit Legacy SSE version: The first source operand and the destination operand are the same.
