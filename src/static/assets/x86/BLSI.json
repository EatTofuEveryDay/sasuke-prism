All other bits in the destination operand are zeroed. If no bits are set in the source operand, BLSI sets all the bits in the destination to 0 and sets ZF and CF."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"This instruction is not supported in real mode and virtual-8086 mode. The operand size is always 32 bits if not in 64-bit mode. In 64-bit mode operand size 64 requires VEX.W1. VEX.W1 is ignored in non-64-bit modes. An attempt to execute this instruction with VEX.L not equal to 0 will cause #UD."},{"name":"C/C++ Intrinsics","value":"`BLSI: unsigned __int32 _blsi_u32(unsigned __int32 src);\n`"},{"name":"\u200b","value":"`BLSI: unsigned __int64 _blsi_u64(unsigned __int64 src);\n`"},{"name":"CPUID Flags","value":"BMI1"}],"color":65535,"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
