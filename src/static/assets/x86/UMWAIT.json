The optimized state may be either a light-weight power/performance optimized state or an improved power/performance optimized state. The selection between the two states is governed by the explicit input register bit[0] source operand."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"UMWAIT is available when CPUID.7.0:ECX.WAITPKG[bit 5] is enumerated as 1.
