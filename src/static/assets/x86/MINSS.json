If a value in the second operand is an SNaN, that SNaN is returned unchanged to the destination (that is, a QNaN version of the SNaN is not returned)."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"If only one value is a NaN (SNaN or QNaN) for this instruction, the second source operand, either a NaN or a valid floating-point value, is written to the result. If instead of this behavior, it is required that the NaN in either source operand be returned, the action of MINSD can be emulated using a sequence of instructions, such as, a comparison followed by AND, ANDN and OR."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The second source operand can be an XMM register or a 32-bit memory location.
