{"title":"RDSEED â€” Read Random SEED","fields":[{"name":"Instruction Modes","value":"`RDSEED r16`\n`RDSEED r32`\n`RDSEED r64`"},{"name":"Description","value":"Loads a hardware generated random value and store it in the destination register. The random value is generated from an Enhanced NRBG (Non Deterministic Random Bit Generator) that is compliant to NIST SP800-90B and NIST SP800-90C in the XOR construction mode. The size of the random value is determined by the destination register size and operating mode. The Carry Flag indicates whether a random value is available at the time the instruction is executed. CF=1 indicates that the data in the destination is valid. Otherwise CF=0 and the data in the destination operand will be returned as zeros for the specified width. All other flags are forced to 0 in either situation. Software must check the state of CF=1 for determining if a valid random seed value has been returned, otherwise it is expected to loop and retry execution of RDSEED (see Section 1.2)."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The RDSEED instruction is available at all privilege levels. The RDSEED instruction executes normally either inside or outside a transaction region."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"In 64-bit mode, the instruction's default operation size is 32 bits. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.B permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64 bit operands. See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits."},{"name":"CPUID Flags","value":"RDSEED"}],"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
