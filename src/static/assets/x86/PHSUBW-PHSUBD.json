(V)PHSUBD performs horizontal subtraction on each adjacent pair of 32-bit signed integers by subtracting the most significant doubleword from the least significant doubleword of each pair, and packs the signed 32-bit result to the destination operand. When the source operand is a 128-bit memory operand, the operand must be aligned on a 16-byte boundary or a general-protection exception (#GP) will be generated."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"Legacy SSE version: Both operands can be MMX registers.
