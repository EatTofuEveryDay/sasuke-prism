{"title":"LAR — Load Access Rights Byte","fields":[{"name":"Instruction Modes","value":"`LAR r16, r16/m16`\n`LAR reg, r32/m161`"},{"name":"Description","value":"Loads the access rights from the segment descriptor specified by the second operand (source operand) into the first operand (destination operand) and sets the ZF flag in the flag register. The source operand (which can be a register or a memory location) contains the segment selector for the segment descriptor being accessed. If the source operand is a memory address, only 16 bits of data are accessed. The destination operand is a general-purpose register."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The processor performs access checks as part of the loading process. Once loaded in the destination register, software can perform additional checks on the access rights information."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The access rights for a segment descriptor include fields located in the second doubleword (bytes 4–7) of the segment descriptor. The following fields are loaded by the LAR instruction:"}],"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
