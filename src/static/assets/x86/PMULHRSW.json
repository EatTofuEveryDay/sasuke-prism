Each intermediate 32-bit integer is truncated to the 18 most significant bits. Rounding is always performed by adding 1 to the least significant bit of the 18-bit intermediate result. The final result is obtained by selecting the 16 bits immediately to the right of the most significant bit of each 18-bit intermediate result and packed to the destination operand."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"When the source operand is a 128-bit memory operand, the operand must be aligned on a 16-byte boundary or a general-protection exception (#GP) will be generated."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"In 64-bit mode and not encoded with VEX/EVEX, use the REX prefix to access XMM8-XMM15 registers."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"Legacy SSE version 64-bit operand: Both operands can be MMX registers.
