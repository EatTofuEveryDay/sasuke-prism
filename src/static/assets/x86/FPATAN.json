The result in register ST(0) has the same sign as the source operand ST(1) and a magnitude less than +π."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The FPATAN instruction returns the angle between the X axis and the line from the origin to the point (X,Y), where Y (the ordinate) is ST(1) and X (the abscissa) is ST(0). The angle depends on the sign of X and Y independently, not just on the sign of the ratio Y/X. This is because a point (−X,Y) is in the second quadrant, resulting in an angle between π/2 and π, while a point (X,−Y) is in the fourth quadrant, resulting in an angle between 0 and −π/2. A point (−X,−Y) is in the third quadrant, giving an angle between −π/2 and −π."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The following table shows the results obtained when computing the arctangent of various classes of numbers, assuming that underflow does not occur."}],"color":65535,"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
