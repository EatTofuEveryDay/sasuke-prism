{"title":"SGDT — Store Global Descriptor Table Register","fields":[{"name":"Description","value":"Stores the content of the global descriptor table register (GDTR) in the destination operand. The destination operand specifies a memory location."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"In legacy or compatibility mode, the destination operand is a 6-byte memory location. If the operand-size attribute is 16 or 32 bits, the 16-bit limit field of the register is stored in the low 2 bytes of the memory location and the 32-bit base address is stored in the high 4 bytes."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"In 64-bit mode, the operand size is fixed at 8+2 bytes. The instruction stores an 8-byte base and a 2-byte limit."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"SGDT is useful only by operating-system software. However, it can be used in application programs without causing an exception to be generated if CR4.UMIP = 0. See “LGDT/LIDT—Load Global/Interrupt Descriptor Table Register” in Chapter 3, Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2A, for information on loading the GDTR and IDTR."}],"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
