(FWAIT is an alternate mnemonic for WAIT.)"},{"name":"\u200b","value":"This instruction is useful for synchronizing exceptions in critical sections of code. Coding a WAIT instruction after a floating-point instruction ensures that any unmasked floating-point exceptions the instruction may raise are handled before the processor can modify the instruction’s results. See the section titled “Floating-Point Exception Synchronization” in Chapter 8 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, for more information on using the WAIT/FWAIT instruction."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode."}],"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
