The FSTCW instruction checks for and handles pending unmasked floating-point exceptions before storing the control word; the FNSTCW instruction does not."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The assembler issues two instructions for the FSTCW instruction (an FWAIT instruction followed by an FNSTCW instruction), and the processor executes each of these instructions in separately. If an exception is generated for either of these instructions, the save EIP points to the instruction that caused the exception."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode."}],"color":65535,"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
