The immediate bits [7:0] determine whether the corresponding single precision floating-point value in the destination is copied from the second source or first source. If a bit in the mask, corresponding to a word, is “1”, then the single-precision floating-point value in the second source operand is copied, else the value in the first source operand is copied."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"128-bit Legacy SSE version: The second source can be an XMM register or an 128-bit memory location.
