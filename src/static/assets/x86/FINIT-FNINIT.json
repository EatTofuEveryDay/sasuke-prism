{"title":"FINIT/FNINIT — Initialize Floating-Point Unit","fields":[{"name":"Instruction Modes","value":"`FINIT`\n`FNINIT*`"},{"name":"Description","value":"Sets the FPU control, status, tag, instruction pointer, and data pointer registers to their default states. The FPU control word is set to 037FH (round to nearest, all exceptions masked, 64-bit precision). The status word is cleared (no exception flags set, TOP is set to 0). The data registers in the register stack are left unchanged, but they are all tagged as empty (11B). Both the instruction and data pointers are cleared."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The FINIT instruction checks for and handles any pending unmasked floating-point exceptions before performing the initialization; the FNINIT instruction does not."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The assembler issues two instructions for the FINIT instruction (an FWAIT instruction followed by an FNINIT instruction), and the processor executes each of these instructions in separately. If an exception is generated for either of these instructions, the save EIP points to the instruction that caused the exception."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode."}],"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
