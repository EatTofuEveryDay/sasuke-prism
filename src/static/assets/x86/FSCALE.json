{"title":"FSCALE â€” Scale","fields":[{"name":"Instruction Modes","value":"`FSCALE`"},{"name":"Description","value":"Truncates the value in the source operand (toward 0) to an integral value and adds that value to the exponent of the destination operand. The destination and source operands are floating-point values located in registers ST(0) and ST(1), respectively. This instruction provides rapid multiplication or division by integral powers of 2. The following table shows the results obtained when scaling various classes of numbers, assuming that neither overflow nor underflow occurs."}],"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
