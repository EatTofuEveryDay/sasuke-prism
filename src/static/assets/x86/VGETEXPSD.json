The integer value of the unbiased exponent is converted to double-precision FP value and written to the destination operand (the first operand) as DP FP numbers. Bits (127:64) of the XMM register destination are copied from corresponding bits in the first source operand."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"The destination must be a XMM register, the source operand can be a XMM register or a float64 memory location.
