Each 64-bit element-pair of a 128-bit lane of the destination operand is interleaved between the corresponding lane of the first source operand and the second source operand at the granularity 128 bits. Each two bits in the imm8 byte, starting from bit 0, is the select control of the corresponding element of a 128-bit lane of the destination to received the shuffled result of an input quadruplet. The two lower elements of a 128-bit lane in the destination receives shuffle results from the quadruple of the first source operand. The next two elements of the destination receives shuffle results from the quadruple of the second source operand."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"EVEX encoded versions: The first source operand is a ZMM/YMM/XMM register.
