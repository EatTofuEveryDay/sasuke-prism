The source operand can be a general-purpose register or a memory location. The action of this instruction depends on the operand size (dividend/divisor). Division using 64-bit operand is available only in 64-bit mode."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"Non-integral results are truncated (chopped) towards 0. The remainder is always less than the divisor in magnitude. Overflow is indicated with the #DE (divide error) exception rather than with the CF flag."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits. Use of the REX.R prefix permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Use of the REX.W prefix promotes operation to 64 bits. In 64-bit mode when REX.W is applied, the instruction divides the unsigned value in RDX:RAX by the source operand and stores the quotient in RAX, the remainder in RDX."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits. See Table 3-15."}],"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
