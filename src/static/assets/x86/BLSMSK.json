If source operand is zero, BLSMSK sets all bits of the destination operand to 1 and also sets CF to 1."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"This instruction is not supported in real mode and virtual-8086 mode. The operand size is always 32 bits if not in 64-bit mode. In 64-bit mode operand size 64 requires VEX.W1. VEX.W1 is ignored in non-64-bit modes. An attempt to execute this instruction with VEX.L not equal to 0 will cause #UD."},{"name":"C/C++ Intriniscs","value":"`BLSMSK: unsigned __int32 _blsmsk_u32(unsigned __int32 src);\n`"},{"name":"\u200b","value":"`BLSMSK: unsigned __int64 _blsmsk_u64(unsigned __int64 src);\n`"},{"name":"CPUID Flags","value":"BMI1"}],"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
