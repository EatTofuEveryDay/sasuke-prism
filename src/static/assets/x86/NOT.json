The destination operand can be a register or a memory location."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the instruction to be executed atomically."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64 bits.
