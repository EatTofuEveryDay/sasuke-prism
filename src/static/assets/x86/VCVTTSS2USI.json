The source operand can be an XMM register or a memory location. The destination operand is a general-purpose register. When the source operand is an XMM register, the single-precision floating-point value is contained in the low doubleword of the register."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"When a conversion is inexact, the value returned is rounded according to the rounding control bits in the MXCSR register. If a converted result cannot be represented in the destination format, the floating-point invalid exception is raised, and if this exception is masked, the integer value 2w – 1 is returned, where w represents the number of bits in the destination format."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"EVEX.W1 version: promotes the instruction to produce 64-bit data in 64-bit mode."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"Note: EVEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b, otherwise instructions will #UD."},{"name":"C/C++ Intrinsics","value":"`VCVTTSS2USI unsigned int _mm_cvttss_u32( __m128 a);\n`"},{"name":"\u200b","value":"`VCVTTSS2USI unsigned int _mm_cvtt_roundss_u32( __m128 a, int sae);\n`"},{"name":"\u200b","value":"`VCVTTSS2USI unsigned __int64 _mm_cvttss_u64( __m128 a);\n`"},{"name":"\u200b","value":"`VCVTTSS2USI unsigned __int64 _mm_cvtt_roundss_u64( __m128 a, int sae);\n`"},{"name":"CPUID Flags","value":"AVX512F"}],"color":65535,"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
