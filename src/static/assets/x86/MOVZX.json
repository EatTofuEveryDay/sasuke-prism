The size of the converted value depends on the operand-size attribute."},{"name":"\u200b","value":"In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits. Use of the REX.R prefix permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Use of the REX.W prefix promotes operation to 64 bit operands. See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits."}],"footer":{"text":"Thanks to Felix Cloutier for the online x86 reference"}}
